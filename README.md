Ruby-qt-diag

Author: Barrels-o-fun
Created: November 2016

A program to demonstrate what is possible with Ruby and Qt
For learning and for reference.

Currently this is for the Qt::Image library only

I'm using Qt 4.8 but I suspect a lot of it transfers across versions

Good references for Ruby & QT:
http://zetcode.com/gui/rubyqt/
http://doc.qt.io/qt-4.8/qimage.html

Keys:
- Q: quit
- Space - Random color

- R: Creates a pattern randomly
- S: Cycles through four different patterns

- I: Refreshes screen (will still affect certain patterns, but won't change colours)

- B: Changes hex offset (Gradient), restricted pallet
- G: Changes hex offset (Gradient), (different) restricted pallet

Box
- L: Change gradient (literally line_length) randomly
- T: Changes thickness of border (random)
- Arrow keys: - Move the highlight over the board
