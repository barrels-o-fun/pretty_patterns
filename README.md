Ruby-qt-diag

Author: Barrels-o-fun
Created: November 2016

A program to demonstrate what is possible with Ruby and Qt
For learning and for reference.

Currently this is for the Qt::Image library only

I'm using Qt 4.8 but I suspect a lot of it transfers across versions

Good references for Ruby & QT:
