Ruby-qt-diag

Author: Barrels-o-fun
Created: November 2016

A program to demonstrate what is possible with Ruby and Qt
For learning and for reference.

Currently this is for the Qt::Image library only

I'm using Qt 4.8 but I suspect a lot of it transfers across versions

Good references for Ruby & QT:
http://zetcode.com/gui/rubyqt/
http://doc.qt.io/qt-4.8/qimage.html

Keys:
Q: quit
Space - Random color

R - Creates a pattern randomly
S - Cycles through four different patterns

I - Refreshes screen (will still affect certain patterns, but won't change colours)

B - Changes hex offset (Gradient), restricted pallet
G - Changes hex offset (Gradient), (different) restricted pallet

Box
L - Change gradient (literally line_length) randomly
T - Changes thickness of border (random)
Arrow keys - Move the highlight over the board
